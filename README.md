# Gen-Z Career Aspirations Analysis

This project focuses on understanding the career aspirations of Generation Z, a demographic group that is expected to constitute 25-27% of the total workforce by 2030. With their unique perspectives and goals, Generation Z will play a significant role in the global economy. However, the differences in career priorities and values between Gen-Z and previous generations are often misunderstood, leading to challenges for both employers and employees.

The goal of this project is to analyze and explore the career aspirations of Generation Z and bridge the gap between their aspirations and the expectations of employers. This will help recruiters better understand how to attract, retain, and manage Gen-Z talent.

## Business Problem

In a rapidly evolving work environment, Generation Z is emerging as a key part of the workforce, yet many organizations face challenges in understanding their career aspirations. This analysis is aimed at identifying the factors that motivate Gen-Z employees, such as:

- Career growth opportunities  
- Financial growth and security  
- Work-life balance  
- Flexibility in the workplace  
- Environmental and social responsibility

By addressing these aspects, companies can better align their recruitment strategies and workplace policies with the expectations of Generation Z.
